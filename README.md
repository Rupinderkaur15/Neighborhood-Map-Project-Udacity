<h2>Neighbourhood Map Project Udacity</h2>

<strong>Created By : Rupinder Kaur </strong>

<h4>Description About The Project</h4>

This is an interactive Neighbourhood map project.In this Project I have created a list of few favorite places i love to visit.</br>
One can choose the location from the list or can enter the place in the provided search box they want to search on google maps.</br>
I have used foursquare Api As my third party api to display some information for the place chosen by the user.
Using Foursquare Api I have accessed the address of the location and Url of the location.
Knockoutjs is used for tracking click events on the list items.
